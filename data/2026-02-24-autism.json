      "summary": "Among the known genetic causes of syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are transcription factor deficiencies. Haploinsufficiency of ZBTB20 leads to Primrose syndrome, comprising severe ASD symptoms with intellectual disability. This study presents comprehensive behavioral characterization of Zbtb20+/- mice, demonstrating diminished sociability, reduced vocalization, repetitive behaviors, and hyperactivity. MRI revealed increased brain volumes. Remarkably, rhEPO treatment improved the behavioral phenotype.",
