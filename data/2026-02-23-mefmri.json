      "title": "Simultaneous Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebrovascular Reactivity Obtained From Novel Multi-Band Multi-Echo Pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (M2-PCASL) Sequence: A Test-Retest Reliability Study.",
      "summary": "This study aimed to assess the reliability of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) obtained simultaneously from a novel multi-band pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (M2-PCASL) sequence with hypercapnic gas challenge. Nine participants underwent test-retest M2-PCASL scans at 3T. Results showed that with smoothing, the M2-PCASL sequence estimated baseline CBF and BOLD CVR with good to excellent reliability (ICC > 0.81) in the whole brain, gray matter, and white matter. The M2-PCASL sequence with hypercapnia reliably estimates baseline CBF and BOLD CVR at improved spatial and temporal resolutions relative to existing methods, enabling noninvasive and comprehensive assessment of cerebrovascular health.",
