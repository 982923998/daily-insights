      "summary": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negatively impacts behavioral health and is co-morbid with neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, most notably substance use disorder (SUD). Neuroimaging studies repeatedly show diminished functional connectivity in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, previous studies appear to disregard any potential for HIV/SUD co-morbidities, an oversight that represents a potential confound in HIV-related neuroimaging literature. Further, the functional connectivity...",

MRI is the reference imaging modality for detecting diffuse axonal injury (DAI), yet the prognostic accuracy and reproducibility of MRI-based radiologic scoring systems remain uncertain. This study aimed to compare the prognostic performance of five published MRI-based DAI scores for predicting 1-year n...",

      "summary": "Omics imaging has emerged as an interdisciplinary field focused on integrating data collected from biomedical images and omics analysis. Historically, there is precedent for omics imaging to serve as a superior model for prediction of human diseases, including brain disorders and cancer, versus single technique models (e.g., only imaging data or only omics data). Most of the previous studies in the field of omics imaging have focused on single organ analysis. However, the advent of total-body Po...",
