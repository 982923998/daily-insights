      "summary": "Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) involves complex and heterogeneous alterations in brain functional organization. A possible explanation is the disruption of individualized brain maturation during adolescents, which typically transitions from lower-order sensory to higher-order association regions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI data using advanced matrix decomposition techniques to extract organizational gradients, temporal dynamics, and information.",
