      "summary": "This study aims to assess the reliability of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) obtained simultaneously from a novel multi-band pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (M2-PCASL) sequence with hypercapnic gas challenge, examining factors influencing CBF variability and evaluating the impact of carbon dioxide concentration on CVR estimates. Nine participants underwent test-retest M2-PCASL scans at 3T with hypercapnia to quantify CBF and CVR. Results showed that with smoothing, the M2-PCASL sequence estimated baseline CBF and BOLD CVR with good to excellent reliability (ICC >0.81) in the whole brain, gray matter, and white matter. The M2-PCASL sequence with hypercapnia reliably estimates baseline CBF and BOLD CVR at improved spatial and temporal resolutions relative to existing methods, enabling noninvasive and comprehensive assessment of cerebrovascular health.",
