      "summary": "Detecting practical biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) before the onset of overt symptoms is crucial for clinicians to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. There is substantial experimental evidence indicating the dysregulation of several microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in AD. They are known to play a crucial role in modulating critical intracellular signaling pathways associated with the core pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association of blood-based miRNAs as non-invasive, cost-effective biomarkers for the early stages of AD, focusing on their impact on cognitive decline and metabolism.",

      "summary": "Conventional functional connectivity of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals varies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, it is unable to describe how white matter (WM) is engaged in brain networks. In this study, we introduced a novel communication connectivity metric, which was defined as the triple-wise correlation coefficient between BOLD signals from pairs of gray matter volume and white matter bundles, to investigate the change of signal transition through WM bundles.",
